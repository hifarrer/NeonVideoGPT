Your task is to build a ChatGPT App named "FFMPEG Video and Audio Tools" by referencing the provided documentation files.

**User Experience:**

1. A user types: `@NeonVideo Make a Music Video`
2. 2. Based on the input we will call the APi with the description of the video in the prompt.
3. The user can also type `@NeonVideo Help` to know all the available commands
4. The user will need to authenticate on NeonVideo.ai to access their account and use their credits to make api calls.
5. The user can see the generated video in a video player.



**Documentation:**

To build this app, you must refer to the following markdown files for all technical implementation details:

- **`APPS_SDK.md`:** For understanding the overall architecture, the `window.openai` API, and how custom UI components work.
- **`MCP_TS_SDK.md`:** For the specific implementation details of the Node.js/TypeScript MCP Server, including how to register tools and structure the server.
- **`API_DOCS.md`:** For the specification of the external API you need to call. This file explains the endpoints, required headers (including `Authorization`), and its request/response format.
